Lets assume we have a code running on our server and many requests are coming and server cant handle these many connections

Scalability: Scalability is the property of a system to handle a growing amount of work by adding resources to the system.

Here we can do two things to improve our scalability.

    => Buy a Bigger Machine  --> Vertical Scaling 
    => Buy more Machine  --> Horizontal Scaling


Horizontal Scaling              |   Vertical Scaling
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Load Balancing Required         |   N/A

if one of machine fails we can  |
redirect to any other. It is    |   Single Point of Failure
called RESILIENT                |

Network call between servers    |   Inter process Communications
(Remote Procedure Calls or RPC) |   (faster)

Data Inconsistency              |   Consistent

Scales well as users increases  |   HardWare limit
