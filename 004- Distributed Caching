Two Scenarios where we have to use cache

    - To save network Calls
    - Avoid Recomputations
    - Reduce DB load

We cannot store too much data as search time will increase and also cost of hardware is very high

Some Good Eviction Policies:
    Sliding window
    LRU

if we have bad eviction policy, (most probably no result will be given for most of the calls)

    - Extra call
    - if we have small cache, Thrashing(inputing and outputing without using data) can happen
    - data consistency


Where to place the Cache?

    => if we place close to server ie.. InMemory. Here amount of memory in server will be used up by cache. if no of results is small and 
       need to save on network call, then it makes sense

       faster and simple

    => global cache, Redis..This is better than InMemory since if server crash is not a problem, and we can upgrade cache independently


Write Through:
    will write the cache and push the changes to db

Write Back:
    Hit the DB and makes sure cache will have null entry
