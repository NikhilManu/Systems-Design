Using DB as Message Queues

    Lets say we have 3 servers S1, S2, S3

    These servers talk to each other via the DB. So if any server is inserting any value to communicate to other server. 
    The DB cannot talk to the server, so other server have to poll the DB at a specific interval.

    Why is this AntiPattern?

        If you are frequent polling (Read Operation), there will be a lot of load on the DB 

        if you are polling at long interval, user experience will be bad and inefficient.

        DB is usually optimized for either reading or writing. if we are performing both operations regularly then it will make issues such as deadlocks etc.

        So if there is frequent communication between the servers, then data will be filled in the db.
        So the only thing to do is either delete or update, which will be expensive and complicated since we may need to use scripts etc.

        This is not scalable, since the db may not be able to handle the load

    
    So we should specialized Messge Queues when we have a large system.

        Message Queues pushes the message to the server.

        there are not too many read operations, writing is easy while reading is its job

        scalability is easy since, we can add them

        Drawback:

            if the system is large no use. So db will be able to handle these kind of loads

            if no lot of communication between servers, here less writing and more reading will be used more. So we can optimise db for read operation
